# Get the Cheese! --- the map game for IntelliJ
This is a simple maze game developed by IntelliJ with Java.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

As usual, you get started by cloning the project to your local machine:

```
https://github.com/Chengcheng2017/GettheCheese_ChengchengW.git
```

### Open and Run Project in IntelliJ IDEA CE

Now that you have cloned the repo:

1. Go to IntelliJ and go to Menu / VCS / Checkout from Version Control / Git

2. Paste the HTTPS path you obtained from GitHub in the previous step and click on [Clone].

At this point, you *should* be able to build and run the project in IntelliJ.

## Running the tests
Run the project. Then there is a maze in the middle and options in the right. Users can click "Reset" to relocate the mouse to the start point, click "First Game", "Next Game", "Previous Game" or "Last Game" to selete games, and click direction buttons to control the movement of the mouse to get the cheese.
